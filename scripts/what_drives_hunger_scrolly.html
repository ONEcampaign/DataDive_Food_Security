        Households in <span style = "background-color:#081248; color:#FFFFFF">low and lower middle-income</span>
        countries spend a much larger share of their income on food.
        <br><br>When the cost of food increases, the burden falls disproportionately on poor people who must use a
        larger share of their income to buy food.
        <br><br>Some may not be able to afford it.

        The prices for oils and cereals have increased significantly.
        <br><br>Since the diets of the poorest people tend to be dominated by staples such as wheat and maize
        (rather than meat)
        <a href = "https://www.one.org/africa/issues/covid-19-tracker/explore-ukraine/"> they are more vulnerable to these shocks.</a>

        Prices for wheat and
       maize, which are staples in many countries,
        have more than doubled since the start of the pandemic.

    <p>
        Prices for sunflower oil and
       palm oil, used for cooking in several countries,
        have also doubled.

        But policies are making the situation worse.
        <br><br>
        In response to the <strong style = "color:#fe4f5e">Ukraine Invasion</strong>, 16 countries (up from 3 countries) are imposing export restrictions on food
        as of early April 2022. This represents <strong>17% of total calories traded</strong>.
        <br><br>During the 2008 food crisis, these policies accounted for <strong>40% of price increases</strong>.
